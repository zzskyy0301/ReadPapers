[paper link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261517305246)


## Contributions
- review restricted & unrestricted platooning methods
- Platooning traffic flow models
- Practical issues(policy, length of queue, road safety)
## Take-aways:
- Unrestrieted, flexible platooning is a potential research area. Mthoeds in ride-sharing and routing can be transferred here.
- Effect of different regulating policies is a potrntial research area. (Length of queue, game theory, surveys..)
- what is heuristic algorithm? [youtube link]()

# Hub-based truck platooning: Potentials and profitability (transportation part E)
## Contributions
- In the present paper we focus on optimising a continuous flow of trucks that passes through a fixed hub location and which have
fixed routes (see Fig. 1);
- Scheduled and dynamic dispatch are solved seperately;
## Methods
- optimization goal: the number of kilometres a given truck m performs as a platoon follower
- mixed integer programming &  heuristic

## Take-aways
- Truck platooning is not a new technology. It has been researched and debated since the 1940s
(Geddes, 1940), and in the last three decades it has resulted in numerous proof of concept projects and demonstration projects
(Stevens, 2015; Benz et al., 1996; Fritz et al., 2004; Alkim et al., 2016). 
- Along these lines, mathematical models for platooning control and optimal stability as well as adaptive cruise control manoeuvres have been developed (e.g, (Sabau et al., 2017;
Nowakowski et al., 2015)). Numerous technological challenges still remain related to platooning, including enabling multi-brand
platooning (Fornells and Arrue, 2014; Brizzolara and Toth, 2016; Berger, 2016), restrictions on platoons in mixed traffic conditions
(Alkim et al., 2016) and incompatible braking and acceleration profiles (Nowakowski et al., 2015).
- The European Truck Platooning Challenge 2016, which was an initiative of
the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, has in a recent report considered the important challenges of platooning
(Alkim et al., 2016), and acknowledges that the formation of platoons (e.g., how to form, maintain and reform platoons during
operations) is a significant challenge.
-Mainly three platooning formation concepts have been considered (Janssen et al., 2015): (i) scheduled platooning, (ii) ‘on-the-fly’ or self-organised
platooning, and (iii) orchestrated platooning facilitated by Platooning Service Providers (PSPs). 
- An overview of previous optimisation studies of platooning schemes is provided in Bhoopalam et al. (2018).
