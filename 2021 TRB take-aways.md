Very Fancy~~ NLP used to perform passenger driving:)
# Paper 2:Opening Remarks from Dr. Henry Liu — 2021 CCAT Global Symposium(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb0o462pE9U)
Collision data imbalanced. Future research direction: Re-sampling of data? simulation of collision? 
# Paper 3: Deep Kinematic Models for Kinematically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Predictions
这玩意儿也能发？
# Paper 4:Collision Avoidance and Stabilization for Autonomous Vehicles in Emergency Scenarios
a good paper to study collision. Future direction: incoporate vehicle mechanics into AV collision avoidance/long-term collisoin avoidance warning
