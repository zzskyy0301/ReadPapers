# Contributions
- review restricted & unrestricted platooning methods
- Platooning traffic flow models
- Practical issues(policy, length of queue, road safety)
# Take-aways:
- Unrestrieted, flexible platooning is a potential research area. Mthoeds in ride-sharing and routing can be transferred here.
